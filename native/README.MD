Assuming that you have Node 14 LTS or greater installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:

```js
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Then run the following commands to create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":

```js
expo init AwesomeProject
cd AwesomeProject
npm start # you can also use: expo start
```

This will start a development server for you.
